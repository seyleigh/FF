### Difficulties

I had an all around difficult time with this assignment. I was straight up having stomach pains from the stress because the logic to push a users answers and compare them to find the friend wasnt working. Turns out it was a typo the whole time. The heroku was a whole other monster. All around a fun learning experience though. 10/10
